  LiveView for managing PayPal subscription trial flows and state.

  ## Subscription Flow Overview

  This LiveView handles the complete PayPal subscription lifecycle:

  1. **Trial Initiation** (`:start_trial` live action)
     * User visits the subscription page with the `:start_trial` live action
     * User clicks "Start Trial" button which triggers `handle_event("request_paypal_approval_url")`
     * `SubscriptionHelpers.request_paypal_approval_url/1` makes the API call to PayPal
     * PayPal creates a subscription in APPROVAL_PENDING state and returns an approval_url

  2. **PayPal Redirection**
     * User is redirected to PayPal's external approval page via `redirect(socket, external: approval_url)`
     * User authenticates with PayPal if needed
     * User reviews the subscription terms (trial period, future billing, etc.)
     * User makes a choice to either approve or cancel the subscription

  3. **Return Processing** (critical stage)
     * `:paypal_return` live action - Triggered when user approves the subscription
       IMPORTANT: At this point, the user has approved the subscription on PayPal's site,
       but PayPal hasn't finalized all processing. The LiveView shows a loading screen with
       "Thank you for your subscription! We are setting up your account now. Please wait..."
       The UI displays a loading indicator while awaiting webhook notifications for final confirmation.
       No further user action is required during this transitional state.

     * `:paypal_cancel` live action - Triggered when user cancels at PayPal's site
       This indicates the user declined to proceed with the subscription.
       The UI provides an option for the user to retry the subscription process,
       allowing them to reconsider their decision and restart the PayPal approval flow.

  4. **Webhook Event Handling**
     * `PartnersWeb.Api.Webhooks.PaypalWebhookController` receives notifications from PayPal
     * The controller validates signatures and processes events like `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.ACTIVATED`
     * The controller explicitly broadcasts these events via Phoenix.PubSub to this LiveView
     * This LiveView receives the broadcasts via `handle_info({:subscription_status_update, ...}, socket)`
     * UI updates happen automatically with no page refresh needed

  ## PayPal Subscription Event Types and Statuses

  ### Event Types and Associated Statuses

  * `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CREATED`
    - Associated status: `APPROVAL_PENDING` (The subscription is created but not yet approved by the buyer)

  * `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.ACTIVATED`
    - Associated status: `ACTIVE` (The subscription is now active)

  * `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.UPDATED`
    - May not change status directly, but updates subscription details

  * `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`
    - Associated status: `CANCELLED` (The subscription has been terminated)

  * `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.SUSPENDED`
    - Associated status: `SUSPENDED` (The subscription is temporarily paused)

  * `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.EXPIRED`
    - Associated status: `EXPIRED` (The subscription has reached its end date)

  * `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.PAYMENT.FAILED`
    - May lead to `SUSPENDED` status if multiple failures occur

  * `PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED`
    - Confirms successful payment, maintains `ACTIVE` status

  ### Complete List of Official Subscription Statuses

  * `APPROVAL_PENDING` - Initial state when subscription is created
  * `APPROVED` - Intermediate state after buyer approval but before activation (NOTE: This status is not associated with any webhook event; it's detected through return URL navigation)
  * `ACTIVE` - Regular active subscription state
  * `SUSPENDED` - Temporarily paused subscription
  * `CANCELLED` - Permanently terminated subscription
  * `EXPIRED` - Subscription that has reached its end date

  ### Status Transitions

  Typical status flow:
  1. `APPROVAL_PENDING` (triggered by `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CREATED`)
  2. `APPROVED` (after buyer approves on PayPal site)
  3. `ACTIVE` (triggered by `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.ACTIVATED`)

  Subscription can then transition to:
  - `SUSPENDED` (triggered by `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.SUSPENDED`)
  - `CANCELLED` (triggered by `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`)
  - `EXPIRED` (triggered by `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.EXPIRED`)

  Note: Refer to PayPal's official documentation for complete details and any updates
  to these statuses or event types.

  ## Key Implementation Details

  * Subscribes to topic `paypal_subscription:{user_id}` for receiving PayPal event broadcasts
  * Maintains subscription state in socket assigns for reactive UI updates
  * Delegates PayPal API interactions to `SubscriptionHelpers` module
  * Renders UI through `PartnersWeb.Subscription.Components.SubscriptionComponents`
  * Supports states: nil (initial), pending, active, cancelled, error
